This project corresponds to Practical Work No. 1 of the subject 'Programming Paradigms' of the University of San Andr√©s, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
It consists of a matrix of "pokemons" (cellular automatons) which interact with their neighbors producing attacks and defenses, these interactions 
affect their HP and as a consequence, their 'type' (element). At the end, you can see which was the strongest element or type with respect to the others.

**HELP**
